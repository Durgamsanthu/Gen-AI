Handwritten Digit Recognition using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
Our project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to recognize handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The MNIST dataset consists of 28x28 pixel grayscale images of handwritten digits (0-9). The CNN model is trained on a subset of the MNIST dataset to learn patterns and features associated with each digit. The model architecture includes multiple convolutional and pooling layers followed by fully connected layers. We use the Adam optimizer and sparse categorical crossentropy loss function for training.
Key Features are:
Utilizes TensorFlow and Keras for deep learning implementation.
Preprocesses the dataset by normalizing pixel values to improve model performance.
Incorporates a CNN architecture optimized for image recognition tasks.
Achieves high accuracy in recognizing handwritten digits on the MNIST test dataset.
Provides a saved model for easy deployment and reuse in other applications.
